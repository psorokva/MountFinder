### The target user is someone living/staying in Vancouver who is interested in going snowboarding.

### *I love to go snowboarding, but I've always found it very time-consuming to go to the website of each separate mountain resort to find out their prices and other information. This gets even more complicated when you are making plans with a group of people, each person with separate needs and preferences. Having one centralized application that allows you to filter by various preferences will greatly simplify this task.*
