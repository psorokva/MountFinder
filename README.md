## Find which mountain to visit for your next snowboarding trip!

### **MountFinder** will keep track of all relevant information about ski resorts near Vancouver and will assist the users with selecting the best option based on their preferences.

**Some examples of relevant information:**
- Lift ticket prices *(based on a date)*
- Gear rental availability
- Gear rental prices
- Season pass options
- Distance from home
- Elevation
- Number of runs
- Difficulty of runs
- Snow conditions

### The target user is someone living/staying in Vancouver who is interested in going snowboarding.

### *I love to go snowboarding, but I've always found it very time-consuming to go to the website of each separate mountain resort to find out their prices and other information. This gets even more complicated when you are making plans with a group of people, each person with separate needs and preferences. Having one centralized application that allows you to filter by various preferences will greatly simplify this task.*
